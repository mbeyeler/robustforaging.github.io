# Robust Visual Foraging Challenge @ NeurIPS 2025

> **Announcement - Public Beta v0.9:**  
> Upcoming v1.0 (planned ‚Äì 1 July 2025) will add:
> 1. Standalone Python API ‚Äì train with any RL framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) without Unity ML-Agents
> 2. Headless Linux builds optimised for SLURM / Kubernetes clusters


Welcome to the official competition page for the **Mouse vs AI: Robust Visual Foraging Challenge**, part of the NeurIPS 2025 Competition Track.

Biological agents like mice can robustly perform visually guided tasks in complex environments ‚Äî even under fog, blur, or visual noise. Can your agent do the same?


## Goal

The goal of this competition is to benchmark and improve the robustness of artificial agents in biologically inspired visual tasks. Specifically, we aim to:

- Evaluate generalization under unseen visual perturbations
- Compare artificial agent performance to real mouse behavior under identical conditions
- Provide a biologically grounded benchmark for embodied visual AI systems
- Offer an neural alignment track to assess how well models align with cortical representations


## Task Overview
Train an agent to navigate a naturalistic environment and reach a visually cued target within‚ÄØtrialtime.
  - Training scene + one perturbation (fog) are provided, distance increases incrementally.
  - Final evaluation uses held‚Äëout perturbations and starts each episode at max target distance.
  - 
The task is adapted from a real neuroscience experiment in which **mice perform the same foraging task**. 
This setup enables comparison between biological and artificial agents under identical visual conditions.


## Quick Start

  ### 1 ¬∑ Download the environment [MouseVsAI_Windows_v0.9.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S7KtiVVI5LaxVFGQlHjV0A1DzFGyklYo) (‚âà 9 GB)

  ### 2 ¬∑ Train your first agent
  
  Follow the **[Training Guide](/training_guide)**
  
  ---
  
  ### 3 ¬∑ Submit your model
  
  Package your trained models and follow the **[Submission Guide](/submission_guide)** to upload to the leaderboard.


## Competition Tracks

### Track 1: Visual Robustness
  Evaluate how well your trained agent generalizes to unseen visual perturbations.  
  - **Metrics**: Average Success Rate (ASR), Minimum Success Rate (MSR) across all provided and held-out conditons
  
### Track 2: Neural Alignment (optional)
  Predict mouse visual cortex activity from internal representations of your agent.  
  - **Metrics**: Mean Pearson correlation between predicted and recorded neural responses
