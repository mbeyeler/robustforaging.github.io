# Robust Visual Foraging Challenge @ NeurIPS 2025

Welcome to the official competition page for the **Mouse vs AI: Robust Visual Foraging Challenge**, part of the NeurIPS 2025 Competition Track.

Biological agents like mice can robustly perform visually guided tasks in complex environments ‚Äî even under fog, blur, or visual noise. Can your agent do the same?


## Goal

The goal of this competition is to benchmark and improve the robustness of artificial agents in biologically inspired visual tasks. Specifically, we aim to:

- Evaluate generalization under unseen visual perturbations
- Compare artificial agent performance to real mouse behavior under identical conditions
- Provide a biologically grounded benchmark for embodied visual AI systems
- Offer an neural alignment track to assess how well models align with cortical representations


## Task Overview
Participants must train reinforcement learning agents to navigate a **naturalistic Unity environment** and reach a visually cued target within 5s. Initially the target is placed close to the agent with target distance increassing as soon as the agent hits a succesor rate of 70%
The clean training environment & one perturbation (fog) is provided, but final evaluation will be conducted including **held-out perturbations**.
The evaluation phase only consist out of trials where the target is placed at the maximum distance.
The task is adapted from a real neuroscience experiment in which **mice perform the same foraging task**. 
This setup enables comparison between biological and artificial agents under identical visual conditions.


## Competition Tracks

  ### Track 1: Visual Robustness
    Evaluate how well your trained agent generalizes to unseen visual perturbations.  
    - **Metrics**: Average Success Rate (ASR), Minimum Success Rate (MSR) across all provided and held-out conditons
  
  ### Track 2: Neural Alignment (optional)
    Predict mouse visual cortex activity from internal representations of your agent.  
    - **Metrics**: Mean Pearson correlation between predicted and recorded neural responses
