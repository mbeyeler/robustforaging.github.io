# Robust Visual Foraging Challenge @ NeurIPS 2025

Welcome to the official competition page for the **Mouse vs AI: Robust Visual Foraging Challenge**, part of the NeurIPS 2025 Competition Track.

Biological agents like mice can robustly perform visually guided tasks in complex environments — even under fog, blur, or visual noise. Can your agent do the same?

## 🧠 Overview
- Train agents in a 3D Unity foraging environment
- Evaluate generalization under **held-out visual perturbations**
- Benchmark against **mouse behavior** and **PPO baselines**
